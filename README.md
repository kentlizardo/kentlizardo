### Hi there!
## Who am I?
I'm Kent, a software engineer, gamedev, and hobbyist.

I originally learned coding through the internet but was formally taught at UIC, earning a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I fell in love with making all kinds of things like apps, art, music, and games.

You can learn more about me [on my personal website](https://www.kentmakes.games)!
